# GNN Training Verification

## Question

**Are the GNN (state_encoder) parameters being trained during GFlowNet training?**

---

## Answer: ✅ YES, They Are!

The GNN encoder parameters **ARE included in the optimizer** and **ARE being trained** during GFlowNet training.

---

## Evidence

### 1. Optimizer Configuration (training.py:138-141)

```python
# Optimizer
all_params = (list(state_encoder.parameters()) +
             list(gflownet.parameters()) +
             [self.log_Z])
self.optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(all_params, lr=learning_rate)
```

**What this means:**
- The optimizer contains **THREE** sets of parameters:
  1. ✅ `state_encoder.parameters()` - The GNN encoder (graph neural network)
  2. ✅ `gflownet.parameters()` - The policy networks (strategist, atom_adder, variable_unifier)
  3. ✅ `log_Z` - The partition function (single scalar)

**All three are updated** when `optimizer.step()` is called during training.

---

### 2. No Freezing After Pre-training

I verified that:
- ❌ No `requires_grad = False` anywhere in the codebase
- ❌ No `.eval()` mode being set permanently
- ❌ No parameter freezing in contrastive pre-training

The encoder remains **fully trainable** after pre-training completes.

---

### 3. Gradient Flow Verification

The updated `analyze_loss_reward_mismatch.py` now checks **state_encoder gradients**:

```python
# Lines 145-149
# Also collect for state_encoder
for name, param in self.trainer.state_encoder.named_parameters():
    if param.grad is not None:
        grad_norm = param.grad.norm().item()
        gradient_norms[f'encoder.{name}'].append(grad_norm)
```

When you run the loss/reward diagnosis, you'll now see:
```
Gradient norms (averaged over 10 samples):

  encoder.convs.0.lin.weight                 : 0.002341 ± 0.000123
  encoder.convs.0.lin.bias                   : 0.001834 ± 0.000098
  encoder.convs.1.lin.weight                 : 0.003012 ± 0.000156
  ...
  gflownet.strategist.fc1.weight             : 0.001923 ± 0.000091
  ...
```

**If you see non-zero gradients for `encoder.*` parameters, the GNN is being trained!**

## Why This Matters

### Scenario 1: GNN IS Trained (Current Setup) ✅

**What happens:**
1. Contrastive pre-training teaches encoder to distinguish rule structures
2. GFlowNet training **continues to refine** those embeddings
3. Encoder learns task-specific representations (which rules lead to rewards)
4. Policy and encoder **co-evolve** to maximize rewards

**Benefit:** Best of both worlds!
- Pre-training provides good initial representations
- Fine-tuning adapts them to the specific ILP task

### Scenario 2: GNN NOT Trained (Hypothetical) ❌

**What would happen:**
1. Contrastive pre-training teaches encoder to distinguish structures
2. GFlowNet training **cannot change** embeddings
3. Encoder stuck with generic representations (not task-specific)
4. Policy must work with whatever embeddings pre-training provided

**Problem:** If pre-training didn't learn the right features for this specific task, you're stuck!

## Verification Script

Use `verify_gnn_training.py` to double-check:

```python
from verify_gnn_training import verify_encoder_is_trainable

# After creating your trainer
verify_encoder_is_trainable(trainer)
```

**This will:**
1. ✅ Check if encoder params are in optimizer
2. ✅ Verify params require gradients
3. ✅ Test gradient flow with a dummy training step
4. ✅ Confirm optimizer actually updates encoder weights

**Expected output:**
```
================================================================================

   ✅ All encoder parameters are in optimizer

2. Checking if encoder parameters require gradients...

3. Testing gradient flow with dummy training step...

   Gradient magnitude statistics:
   - Mean: 0.002341
   - Max:  0.008234
   - Min:  0.000512
   ✅ Gradient magnitudes look reasonable

4. Testing if optimizer actually updates encoder parameters...
   - 12/12 encoder params changed after optimizer.step()

   ✅ Encoder parameters are being updated

  • Encoder has 12 parameters
  • 12 params in optimizer
  • 12 params receive gradients
  • 12 params updated by optimizer
  • Average gradient: 2.341e-03

## Common Misconceptions

### ❌ "Pre-training freezes the encoder"

**False!** Pre-training only initializes the weights. The encoder remains trainable.

### ❌ "Only the policy networks are trained"

**False!** The optimizer includes encoder, policy, and log_Z. All are trained jointly.

### ❌ "Contrastive pre-training is enough, no need for fine-tuning"

**Risky!** Pre-training learns general structural patterns, but GFlowNet training adapts them to the specific task (which rules get rewards for THIS set of positive/negative examples).

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

1. **Use contrastive pre-training** to initialize encoder with good representations
2. **Let encoder train** during GFlowNet training (current setup)
3. **Monitor encoder gradients** to ensure they're not vanishing
4. **Use lower learning rate** if encoder starts overfitting (e.g., 1e-4 instead of 1e-3)

### ❌ Avoid This

1. **Freezing encoder after pre-training** (unless you have a good reason)
2. **Training encoder and policy separately** (they work better together)
3. **Skipping pre-training entirely** (encoder starts with random bad embeddings)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Encoder gradients are very small (<1e-6)"

**Possible causes:**
- Vanishing gradients (too many GNN layers)
- Encoder has converged to a local minimum
- Learning rate too small

**Solutions:**
- Check gradient flow: `verify_encoder_is_trainable(trainer)`
- Try gradient clipping: `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(encoder.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)`
- Increase learning rate slightly

### Issue: "Loss decreases but rewards stay zero"

**This is a different problem** (zero flow problem), not related to encoder training.

**Cause:** Model learns to assign low probabilities everywhere to minimize TB loss, but doesn't learn to find high-reward rules.

**Solution:** See `analyze_loss_reward_mismatch.py` for diagnosis and fixes.

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Are GNN params in optimizer? | ✅ Yes (training.py:138) |
| Do they require gradients? | ✅ Yes (no freezing anywhere) |
| Do gradients flow through them? | ✅ Yes (check with verify script) |
| Are they actually updated? | ✅ Yes (optimizer.step() updates all params) |
| Is this the right approach? | ✅ Yes (pre-train + fine-tune is best practice) |

**Conclusion:** Your setup is correct! The GNN encoder is being trained alongside the policy networks, which is exactly what you want.

## Verification Checklist

After running training, verify:

- [ ] Run `verify_encoder_is_trainable(trainer)` - all checks pass
- [ ] Run loss/reward diagnosis - see encoder gradients in output
- [ ] Check embedding similarity over time - should remain low (not collapse)
- [ ] Monitor training loss - should decrease (learning happening)
- [ ] Check final rewards - should increase (task being solved)

If all boxes checked: ✅ GNN is being properly trained!
