# Changelog

## Recent Updates

### Top-N Hypothesis Sampling (Latest)

**Added:**
- `sample_top_theories()` method to `GFlowNetTrainer` for sampling multiple top hypotheses
- Returns top K theories ranked by reward instead of just the best
- Backward compatible with existing `sample_best_theory()` API

**Files Modified:**
- `training.py`: Added `sample_top_theories()`, refactored `sample_best_theory()` to use it

**Files Added:**
- `test_top_n.py`: Test suite for top-N sampling
- `test_diverse_hypotheses.py`: Diversity analysis tests
- `USAGE_TOP_N.md`: Complete usage guide

**API:**
```python
# New method
top_theories = trainer.sample_top_theories(
    initial_state, pos_examples, neg_examples,
    num_samples=50,  # How many to sample
    top_k=5          # How many to return
)
# Returns: List[(Theory, float)] sorted by reward

# Old method (still works)
best_theory, best_reward = trainer.sample_best_theory(
    initial_state, pos_examples, neg_examples,
    num_samples=10
)
# Returns: (Theory, float)
```

**Use Cases:**
- Ensemble methods
- Exploring alternative formulations
- Diversity analysis
- Beam search
- Active learning

### Improved Reward Function

**Changed:**
- Switched from additive to **multiplicative accuracy**: `accuracy = pos_score × neg_score`
- This requires BOTH high positive coverage AND high negative avoidance
- Reduced weights: pos=0.8, neg=0.8 → accuracy weight=0.9
- Reduced simplicity weight: 0.1 → 0.01

**Added:**
- Penalty for **uninformative rules** that cover everything
- Rules covering all positives AND all negatives get -0.9 penalty
- Prevents convergence to overly general empty rules

**Files Modified:**
- `reward.py`: Updated `RewardCalculator.__init__()` and `calculate_reward()`

**Impact:**
- **Before**: Model converged to reward ~0.33 with uninformative rules
- **After**: Model converges to reward 1.0 with correct rules
- Successfully learned `target(X0, X0)` for identity relation

**Results:**
```
Old reward function:
  Empty rule target(X0, X1): reward = 0.325
  (covers all positives AND negatives)

New reward function:
  Uninformative rule: reward = 0.0 (penalty applied)
  Correct rule target(X0, X0): reward = 1.0
  (covers positives, avoids negatives)
```

## Migration Guide

### For Users of `sample_best_theory()`

No changes needed! Your code will continue to work:

```python
# This still works exactly as before
best_theory, best_reward = trainer.sample_best_theory(
    initial_state, pos_examples, neg_examples, num_samples=10
)
```

### To Use Top-N Sampling

Simply use the new method:

```python
# Get top-5 hypotheses
top_5 = trainer.sample_top_theories(
    initial_state, pos_examples, neg_examples,
    num_samples=50, top_k=5
)

for theory, reward in top_5:
    print(f"{theory_to_string(theory)}: {reward:.4f}")
```

### For Custom Reward Functions

The new reward function defaults work better, but you can customize:

```python
# Old defaults (problematic)
reward_calc = RewardCalculator(
    engine,
    weight_pos=0.6,
    weight_neg=0.3,
    weight_simplicity=0.1
)

# New defaults (recommended)
reward_calc = RewardCalculator(
    engine,
    weight_pos=0.8,  # Used for multiplicative accuracy
    weight_neg=0.8,  # Used for multiplicative accuracy
    weight_simplicity=0.01
)

# Actual formula: 0.9 * (pos × neg) + 0.1 * simplicity - penalty
```

## Performance

No performance regressions introduced:
- Top-N sampling: O(num_samples × trajectory_length) + O(n log n) sort
- Training speed unchanged
- Memory usage: O(num_samples) during sampling

---

## Next Steps (Optional Future Work)

Potential enhancements:
- [ ] Background knowledge support in logic engine
- [ ] Beam search during trajectory generation
- [ ] Temperature-based sampling
- [ ] Diversity-encouraging exploration bonuses
- [ ] More sophisticated backward policies
- [ ] Rule pruning and post-processing
- [ ] Multi-rule theories (currently single rule)
